ðŸš— Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) â€” Complete Guide

1. What is ADAS?
Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are technologies that assist the driver in the driving process, enhancing:
- Safety
- Comfort
- Efficiency

They act as a bridge between manual driving and autonomous driving (AVs).

Analogy:
- Eyes â†’ sensors (camera, radar, lidar, IMU, GNSS)
- Brain â†’ algorithms (perception, planning, control)
- Muscles â†’ actuators (steering, throttle, brakes)

------------------------------------------------------------

2. System Architecture

(a) Perception â€“ "Seeing the World"
- Sensors:
  * Cameras â†’ lane lines, traffic signs, pedestrians
  * Radar â†’ speed & distance detection, works in bad weather
  * LiDAR â†’ 3D environment mapping
  * IMU + GNSS â†’ vehicle position & orientation
- Algorithms:
  * Sensor fusion (e.g., Kalman Filter, Particle Filter)
  * Object detection (CNNs, YOLO)
- Output: environment map + vehicle state
Example: Lane Departure Warning uses a camera + CNN.

(b) Planning â€“ "Deciding What to Do"
Two layers:
1. Path Planning â†’ geometric path
2. Motion Planning â†’ adds timing (speed, acceleration, jerk)

Considers safety, comfort, and constraints.
Uses global map + local environment.
Example: Adaptive Cruise Control adjusts speed based on traffic.

(c) Control â€“ "Executing the Plan"
Controls actuators to follow the planned trajectory.
- Longitudinal Control:
  Inputs: throttle, brake  
  Outputs: velocity, acceleration
- Lateral Control:
  Input: steering angle  
  Outputs: heading, lane position

Goals:
- Stability
- Tracking accuracy
- Robustness under disturbances

------------------------------------------------------------

3. Mathematical Foundations

(a) Kinematic Model (Simplified)
Good for low speeds.
Equations:
x_dot = v * cos(theta + beta)
y_dot = v * sin(theta + beta)
theta_dot = (v * tan(delta) * cos(beta)) / L
v_dot = a

(b) Dynamic Model (Detailed)
Adds forces & torques (for high-speed maneuvers).
- Tire cornering forces
- Aerodynamic drag
- Rolling resistance
- Governs lateral acceleration & yaw rate

------------------------------------------------------------

4. Control Strategies

Traditional Control:
- Bang-Bang Control â†’ on/off (unstable, rarely used)
- PID Control:
  * P â†’ corrects present error
  * I â†’ corrects accumulated error
  * D â†’ predicts future error
- Model Predictive Control (MPC):
  * Predicts future states & solves optimization
  * Handles constraints (steering limits, safety)
  * Computationally heavy

Learning-Based Control:
1. Imitation Learning (Behavioral Cloning)
   - Learns from human driving data
   - Risk: poor generalization if data is biased
2. Reinforcement Learning (RL)
   - Learns via trial-and-error with rewards
   - Can outperform traditional methods
   - Example: PPO for lane keeping

------------------------------------------------------------

5. Key State Estimation: Sideslip Angle (Î²)

Definition:
Angle between vehicleâ€™s heading and actual velocity direction.

Why important:
- Critical for stability & control
- Affects yaw control and lane keeping

Estimation Methods:
- Onboard sensors (IMU, WSS, SWAS)
- GNSS-augmented approaches
- AI-based fusion methods (e.g., LSTM + EKF)

Formula:
Î² = arctan(vy / vx)

------------------------------------------------------------

6. Collaborative ADAS â†’ Toward CAVs

ADAS evolves into CAVs (Connected & Automated Vehicles) via V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything):
- Centralized Control: traffic server coordinates all cars
- Decentralized Control: each car decides locally
- Mixed Control: hybrid (most practical)

Applications:
- Platooning (fuel saving + safety)
- Cooperative merging
- Intersection management
- Energy-efficient routing

------------------------------------------------------------

7. Current Challenges
- Real-time computation (MPC can be slow)
- Robustness in bad weather & sensor noise
- Interpretability of AI-based control
- Human trust & safety validation

------------------------------------------------------------

8. ADAS â†’ Full Autonomy Path (SAE Levels)
1. Level 1: Driver Assistance (Cruise Control)
2. Level 2: Partial Automation (Lane Keeping + ACC)
3. Level 3: Conditional Automation (hands off, driver must intervene)
4. Level 4: High Automation (autonomy in defined areas)
5. Level 5: Full Automation (no steering wheel)

------------------------------------------------------------

âœ… Summary
ADAS integrates Perception â†’ Planning â†’ Control â†’ Actuation:
- Perception: understands the world
- Planning: decides what to do
- Control: computes steering, throttle, brakes
- Actuation: executes commands

It is the stepping stone to fully autonomous driving.
