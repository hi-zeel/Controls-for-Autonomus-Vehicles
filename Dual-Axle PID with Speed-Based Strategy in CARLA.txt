##  Dual-Axle PID Lane Keeping in CARLA

### Strategy
- Rear steering follows front with speed-based factor:
  - Low speed (<8 m/s): rear opposite front (maneuverability).
  - High speed (â‰¥8 m/s): rear same as front (stability).

### Implementation
- PID controls front steering offset.
- Rear steering computed as factor of front.
- Combined steering applied in CARLA VehicleControl.

### Results
- Lane offset reduced faster than single PID.
- Steering smoother at high speed.
- Confirms theory: dual-axle control improves both stability and maneuverability.
